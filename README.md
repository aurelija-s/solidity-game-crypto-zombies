# Crypto Zombies game
### I followed the tutorial to make a game on Ethereum to learn the basics of solidity.
 Tutorial covered creating zombies, making them attact their victims, multiply and battle. Tutorial is also focusing on contract ownership, gas costs, code optimization, and security, payable functions and how to build Decentralized apps accepting money from players.
 
 Tutorial also covers the ERC721 standard tokens and crypto-collectible assets, so that Zombies can be traded.
